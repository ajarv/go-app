      <h3>Hey There</h3>
      <p>There are two types of addictions.</p> 
      <p>First type are when euphoria comes first and questioning later. e.g. You go to a party and you start drinking .. you feel good very good and you drink more. Later on next day you have a hangover and you question youself.
        - Why did I have to drink so much?</p>
      <p>The second thpe is where questioning comes first and euphoria follows. e.g. Its 5 am , slightly cold outside and you are questioning yourself . Should I get out of bed and go for the Jog ?  You finally go and at 7 am when you come
        back home you are feeling very good. </p>
      <p>Avoid the first type of addictions. Adopt the second type.</p>
